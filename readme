If you want to reproduce the experiment presented in the arXiv paper, you should have python and sage installed on your computer.
Then follow the steps

1) in file bezout_2.py :
- do not modify line 8 ; this line should write 
deg = [2, 2, 2, 2]
- uncomment line 30, this line should write
P = load('P_'+''.join(str(e) for e in deg)+'.sobj')
- comment line 31, this line should write
# P = [bz.rand_poly(n-1, m, deg, t, x) for i in range(n)] + xx

2) from within the directory python open a linux terminal 
from within this terminal execute the command
sage
this will open a sage terminal, from within the sage terminal execute the command 
runfile("bezout_2.sage")
this will make all the calculations; wait as long as necessary.
After the calculations have been completed, the results are written in some files *.txt, with explicit names, in the directory tex/txt ; 


3) If you want these results to appear in the paper entitled "Solving zero-dimensional polynomial systems: a practical method using Bezout matrices" (file "bezout.pdf" located in the directory tex), you must have latex installed on your computer.
Then, open a terminal in the directory tex and execute the command 
pdflatex bezout.tex
this will create, or update, the file bezout.pdf, with the results of your own calculations.
