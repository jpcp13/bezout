HOM4PS-2.0: HOMotopy method for solving Polynomial Systems

1. Features:

   1. Run on 64-bit Linux operating system (x86-64/AMD-64/Intel-64).
   2. No library installation is needed.
   3. No compiler is needed.
   4. One option (switch between Polyhedral homotopy and Linear homotopy).

===========================
2. Generate the input file:

   The input file should contain the system of polynomials
   in the following format:

           {
           1st polynomial;
           2nd polynomial;
           ......
           nth polynomial;
           }

   The file starts with a "{" and ends with a "}". Each polynomial ends
   with a ";". Sample files are shown in the directory HOM4PS2/equations.

===========================
2. Run the code:

   In the directory HOM4PS2, run "./hom4ps2" following by
   the input file name.

   For the example of the input file named "cyclic5", run the command

             ./hom4ps2 cyclic5

   The isolated roots of the polynomial system will be stored
   in the file HOM4PS2/data.roots.
