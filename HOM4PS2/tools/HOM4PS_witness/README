HOM4PS_witness: homotopy method for finding witness points

Note: 
   A witness point is the intersection point of a positive dimensional variety
   and randomly generated hyperplanes.

Purpose:
   Check whether a polynomial system has any positive dimensional variety.



===========================
Run the code:

   In the directory HOM4PS_witness, run batch file "./hom4ps_witness" following
   by Input_File_Name. And then key in the number of hyperplanes.


   For checking whether cyclic4 has one dimensional variety, run the command

             ./hom4ps_witness cyclic4

   and then key in 1.

   The witness points will be stored in the file data.witness.
