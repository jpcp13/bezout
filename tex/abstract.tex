\begin{abstract}
Let $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ be the algebra of polynomials, with rational coefficients in the variables $x = x_1, \ldots, x_n$.
Given in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ a zero-dimensional ideal $I = \left< P_1, \ldots, P_n \right>$, we present a pactical and efficient method to compute the algebraic structure of the quotient algebra $ A = \mathbb{Q}[x]/I$ from which one can compute numerical approximations of the roots of $I$.
The entire method consists in matrix computations. All the computations can be done in floating arithmetic or in exact arithmetic, but the more robust and efficient approach is to mix both arithmetics.
A set of experiments illustrate the method's effectiveness.
